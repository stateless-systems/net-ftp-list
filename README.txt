= Net::Ftp::List

== DESCRIPTION

Ruby lib to parse FTP LIST responses.

According to the FTP RFC the LIST command "information on a file may vary widely from system to system, this
information may be hard to use automatically in a program, but may be quite useful to a human user".
Unfortunately the NLST command "intended to return information that can be used by a program to further process
the files automatically" only returns the filename and no other information. If you want to know to know even
simple things like 'is the NLST entry a directory or file' you are left with the choice of attempting to CWD to
(and back from) each entry or parsing the LIST command. This extension is an attempt at parsing the LIST command
and as such is subject to all the variability that results from such an undertaking, take responses with a grain
of salt and expect failures.

See the RFC for more guff on LIST and NLST: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0959.txt

== TODO & PROBLEMS

* The factory and abstract base class for parsers are one and the same. OO geeks will cry.
* More OS's and server types. Only servers that return Unix like LIST responses will work at the moment.
* Calling <tt>if entry.file? or entry.dir?</tt> is hard work when you really mean <tt>unless entry.unknown?</tt>

== SYNOPSIS

  require 'net/ftp' # Not really required but I like to list dependencies sometimes.
  require 'net/ftp/list'

  ftp = Net::FTP.open('somehost.com', 'user', 'pass')
  ftp.list('/some/path') do |e|
    entry = Net::FTP::List.parse(e)

    # Ignore everything that's not a file (so symlinks, directories and devices etc.)
    next unless entry.file?

    # If entry isn't entry.unknown? then there is a bug in Net::FTP::List if this isn't the
    # same name as ftp.nlist('/some/path') would have returned.
    # Format the entry showing its file size and modification time
    puts "#{entry.basename}, #{entry.filesize}, #{entry.mtime}"

  end
